        <!--open second column(used for text)-->
        <p>For this project as the UX/UI designer for this project the brief was to select an app concept of my
          choosing that would solve a specific user problem, the only requirement was to design for both iOS
          and Android and native.The solution to this problem was to develop a mental
          health care app that would be accessible to everyone. The name of this app would be called Awaken.
          They will be able to select what type of therapy they are looking for (depression, anxiety, anger,
          stress, relationship, grief, self-esteem, eating disorder, borderline personality disorder) they will have
          the option of having a private mode or public when receiving therapy.</p>

      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>According to Hopkins Medicine and the latest statistics available from the National Institute of Mental Health Disorders, part of the National Institutes of Health:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Mental health disorders account for several of the top causes of disability in established market economies, such as the U.S., worldwide, and include: major depression (also called clinical depression), manic depression (also called
          bipolar disorder), schizophrenia, and obsessive-compulsive disorder.</li>
        <li>An estimated 26% of Americans ages 18 and older - about 1 in 4 adults - suffers from a diagnosable mental disorder in a given year.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>The Problem</h3>
      <p>The problem that the app is solving is to make therapy/counseling for mental illness as accessible to the user. Therapy can be expensive, it would be nice to make it more accessible and trustworthy. This app will be a native app and would be
        designed for both iOS and Android to create that accessibility. The user will have the ability to have access to a therapist (phone call, video call, or messaging) whenever they are feeling anxious or in need of help.</p>
      <h3>The Solution</h3>
      <p>The app Awaken will be for users that are seeking therapy for mental help. They will be able to select what type of therapy they are looking for (depression, anxiety, anger, stress, relationship, grief, self-esteem, eating disorder,
        borderline personality disorder) they will have the option of having a private mode or public when receiving therapy. The app will also help track habits and moods, cataloguing moods and habits using the Cognitive Behavioral Therapy method.
        Other features will include daily motivational reminders and facts on mental illness and suggestion for podcast and music for relaxation. This app for people that want to be happy and are seeking help, guidance and a way to find mental
        balance in their lives.</p>

      <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
      <p>For the competitive analysis I took a look at the apps Thought Diary and Calm app. There were some fuctionalities that worked well in both apps and I drew inspiration for my project, the only difference is that AWAKEN offers therapy
        sessions.</p>

      <p>Cognitive Thought Diary is a journaling app that uses tools from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and positive psychology to help consumers track and improve their moods and to reframe their thinking. Consumers can choose between reporting a
        thought, mood, or expression of gratitude. The app will guide consumers through specific exercises such as challenging their negative thoughts.</p>

      <p>Calm is a meditation, sleep and relaxation app. Calm creates unique audio content that strengthens mental fitness and tackles some of the biggest mental health challenges of today: stress, anxiety, insomnia, and depression. The most popular
        feature on Calm is a 10-minute meditation called, 'The Daily Calm,' that explores a fresh mindful theme and inspiring concept each day.</p>

      <h2>User Flow &amp; Wireframes</h2>
      <p>After evaluating other mental health and wellness apps, I proceeded with creating a userflow and the low-fidelity wireframes. The main functionalities for the app include: sign-up, login, matching the user with a therapist, mood tracking and
        selection of a daily productivity task.</p>

      <h2>Style Guide</h2>
      <p>The overall aesthetic for AWAKEN is to bring solace and well-being to the user. The imagery is warm and comforting. Earth and natural tones were used for the color palette. Helvetica for ease of legibility. The app should create an
        atmosphere of calm and peace.</p>

      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>The brief of this project called for a design of an iOS and Android version of a mobile app that solves a specific user problem as well as the analysis of two competing apps in the market. With the research on the topic of mental health apps
        such as Calm and Thought Dairy, as well as the feedback from user testing, I was able to gain insight on what people seek in such apps. I was shocked to realize that many loved the idea of the app and felt that AWAKEN would truly help those
        in need of therapy or who are facing mental health issues in general. I feel that without the limitation of time restraints for the project, I could have dived more into specifics such as how payment would work (insurance or subscription
        based) and fine tune being matched with therapist, the legality and privacy issues. All in all, I really enjoyed this project because I got to select a concept I am passionate about. I would love to revisit this project in the future and
        refine it, I truly believe that mental health care and wellness should be more accessible and affordable to the public.</p>
